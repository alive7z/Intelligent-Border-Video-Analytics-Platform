# IBVAP

Current rollout status: [11 September stabilization report](docs/IBVAP-STABILIZATION-2026-09-11.md). The Border Map remains active. CAM-01/CAM-02 live verification awaits their source URLs; see the report for tested results, startup commands and remaining limitations.

## Intelligent Border Video Analytics Platform

**IBVAP** is a context-aware border surveillance platform designed to enhance existing CCTV infrastructure with real-time computer vision, tracking, contextual analysis, risk scoring, alert generation, evidence management, analytics, and command-and-control capabilities.

> **Detection → Tracking → Context → Behavior → Risk → Alert → Evidence → Operator Action**

IBVAP does not treat every person or vehicle detection as an immediate security threat. Instead, it evaluates factors such as location, duration, zone interaction, fence activity, and behavior before calculating risk and escalating meaningful incidents.

---

## Problem

Traditional CCTV surveillance systems depend heavily on continuous manual monitoring. Security personnel may need to watch multiple camera feeds simultaneously, which can lead to:

- Operator fatigue
- Missed suspicious activity
- Delayed incident response
- Continuous bandwidth consumption
- Large volumes of unstructured footage
- Limited contextual understanding
- Difficulty prioritizing important incidents

IBVAP addresses these challenges by adding an intelligent software and edge-processing layer over existing IP CCTV infrastructure.

---

## Solution

IBVAP connects to existing CCTV cameras using standard video-surveillance protocols such as **RTSP** and **ONVIF**.

Live video is processed through a computer-vision pipeline that performs:

- Person detection
- Vehicle detection
- Multi-object tracking
- Face detection
- Number plate OCR
- Loitering analysis
- Restricted-zone monitoring
- Virtual-fence crossing detection
- Fence-proximity monitoring
- Context analysis
- Risk scoring

Routine detections remain normal events.

Only meaningful combinations of contextual conditions are escalated into security alerts.

# Core Design Principle

IBVAP follows a context-first surveillance workflow:

```text
Detection
   ↓
Tracking
   ↓
Context
   ↓
Behavior / Duration
   ↓
Risk
   ↓
Alert
   ↓
Evidence
   ↓
Operator Action
```

Example:

```text
PERSON_DETECTED
      ↓
Track maintained over time
      ↓
Loitering / Fence Proximity /
Restricted Zone / Fence Crossing
      ↓
Context Analysis
      ↓
Risk Engine
      ↓
SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY
      ↓
Node Alert Manager
      ↓
Alert + Evidence
```

A normal detection remains an event.

An alert is created only when the risk or configured rules indicate that operator attention is required.

---

# Key Features

## Live Surveillance

- Existing CCTV / IP camera integration
- RTSP video ingestion
- Camera status monitoring
- Live annotated preview
- Multi-camera support
- Camera-specific configuration
- Stream reconnection handling
- Secure browser preview

---

## Detection and Tracking

- Person detection
- Vehicle detection

---

## Context Analysis

IBVAP evaluates surveillance activity using contextual rules such as:

- Loitering
- Restricted-zone entry
- Virtual-fence crossing
- Fence proximity
- Zone interaction
- Duration
- Temporal behavior
- Camera-specific surveillance rules

---

## Risk Engine

IBVAP does not consider every detection a threat.

Risk can be calculated using multiple independent contextual conditions associated with the same tracked object.

```text
Loitering
+
Fence Proximity
+
Restricted Zone Entry
+
Virtual Fence Crossing
        ↓
Combined Risk Score
        ↓
Severity
```

Supported severity levels:

- INFO
- LOW
- MEDIUM
- HIGH
- CRITICAL

Risk values come from configured risk rules rather than hardcoded frontend values.

---

# Events and Alerts

## Events

Events represent surveillance observations.

Examples include:

```text
PERSON_DETECTED
VEHICLE_DETECTED
FACE_DETECTED
PLATE_DETECTED
LOITERING
FENCE_PROXIMITY
VIRTUAL_FENCE_CROSSING
RESTRICTED_ZONE_ENTRY
SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY
```

## Alerts

Alerts represent higher-priority incidents requiring operator attention.

The **Node.js Alert Manager** is responsible for alert creation and lifecycle management.

The Python vision engine generates structured observations and risk information, but it does not independently create final alerts.

---

# Evidence Management

For qualifying incidents, IBVAP can preserve:

- Event snapshots
- Confirmed plate crops
- Face-detection crops
- Evidence metadata
- Event associations
- Alert associations

Large media files are stored in controlled evidence storage.

Structured metadata is stored in MySQL.

---

# Intelligence

The Intelligence module provides structured surveillance observations for vehicles, number plates, and face detections.

## Vehicle Intelligence

Includes:

- Vehicle detection
- Vehicle class
- Track ID
- Camera information
- Detection confidence
- Timestamp

## ANPR

Includes:

- Number plate OCR
- Plate validation
- OCR confidence
- Camera association
- Vehicle association

## Face Events

Includes:

- Face detection
- Face snapshots
- Track association
- Camera association

> IBVAP currently performs **face detection only**. It does not perform facial recognition or identity matching.

---

# Border Map

The geographic surveillance map provides:

- Camera locations
- Camera status
- Alert locations
- Geographic zones
- Map filters
- Current device location
- Command-level situational awareness

Camera-frame surveillance coordinates and geographic latitude/longitude coordinates are treated as separate coordinate systems.

---

# Analytics

IBVAP provides operational analytics such as:

- Events by type
- Events by severity
- Alert distribution
- Alert trends
- Risk distribution
- Operator workload
- Alert acknowledgement metrics
- Resolution metrics
- Camera health
- Evidence statistics
- Storage statistics

---

# Why These Technologies?

## React + Tailwind CSS

Used to build the command-and-control dashboard, surveillance interface, events, alerts, analytics, maps, and administration pages.

React provides reusable UI components while Tailwind CSS provides consistent and responsive styling.

---

## Node.js + Express

Node.js acts as the primary application and control backend.

It handles:

- Authentication
- RBAC
- Users
- Operators
- Cameras
- Events
- Alerts
- Administration
- Retention
- Audit logs
- Database APIs
- Realtime communication

---

## Python + FastAPI

Python powers the vision-processing engine because of its strong ecosystem for:

- YOLO
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Tracking
- OCR
- Computer vision

FastAPI exposes the Python processing service through lightweight internal APIs.

---

## YOLO11

YOLO11 is used for realtime object detection.

It detects objects such as:

- People
- Cars
- Trucks
- Buses
- Motorcycles

---

## ByteTrack

ByteTrack maintains object identities across successive frames.

Without tracking:

```text
Frame 1 → Person
Frame 2 → Person
Frame 3 → Person
```

could be treated as unrelated detections.

With tracking:

```text
Frame 1 → Track 17
Frame 2 → Track 17
Frame 3 → Track 17
```

This allows IBVAP to calculate:

- Loiter duration
- Zone interaction
- Fence proximity
- Tracking continuity
- Risk progression
- Duplicate-event prevention

---

## OpenCV

OpenCV is used for:

- Frame processing
- Image manipulation
- Bounding-box operations
- Cropping
- Overlay rendering
- Evidence generation
- Video processing

---

## EasyOCR

EasyOCR is used to extract text from candidate number-plate regions.

Only valid OCR observations that satisfy configured validation rules are persisted.

---

## YuNet

YuNet is used for lightweight face detection.

IBVAP deliberately separates:

```text
Face Detection ✅
Face Recognition ❌
```

No persistent human identity is inferred from detected faces.

---

## MySQL

MySQL stores persistent structured application data including:

- Users
- Operators
- Cameras
- Events
- Alerts
- Zones
- Risk rules
- Plate observations
- Evidence metadata
- Audit records
- Retention settings

---

## Redis

Redis is used for temporary and fast-access runtime data such as:

- Cache
- Rate limiting
- Transient state
- Realtime-support functionality

Redis is not the primary persistent database.

---

## RTSP

## Key Difference from BriefCam

BriefCam focuses heavily on making surveillance footage searchable, reviewable, and actionable across broad enterprise use cases.

IBVAP focuses specifically on the border-security decision pipeline:

> **Detection → Tracking → Context → Risk → Alert → Evidence → Operator**

The primary IBVAP differentiator is not simply object detection.

It is the combination of:

- Tracking
- Zone interaction
- Behavior
- Duration
- Fence activity
- Context
- Configurable security rules
- Risk aggregation

before an incident is escalated.

IBVAP does not claim to replace or outperform a mature commercial platform such as BriefCam.

Its focus is a specialized, modular, edge-oriented architecture for border surveillance using existing CCTV infrastructure.
